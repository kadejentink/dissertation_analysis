# Dissertation analysis
This is the set of code I primarily used to analyze my dissertation

This code: establishes RSA parameters, runs RSA on fMRI data, imports data from local to standard space, and runs the group t-test

I used a Jupyter Notebook for the "pipeline" to more easily interact with each step of the process. The "debug" Notebook accomplishes a similar goal with the idea that it functions more as a testing environment, and once I'm satisfied with something, I add it to the pipeline.
