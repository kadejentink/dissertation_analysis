# Dissertation analysis
This is the set of code I primarily used to analyze my dissertation

This code: establishes RSA parameters, runs RSA on fMRI data, imports data from local to standard space, and runs the group t-test

The "debug" Notebook functions as an interactive testing environment for the entire pipeline, and once I'm satisfied with something in the testing environment, I add it to the pipeline
